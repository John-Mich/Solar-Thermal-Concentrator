# Solar-Thermal-Concentrator

High efficiency solar thermal concentrator with single curvature parabolic reflectors

Introduction

Many designs of solar concentration devices have been constructed with different advantages, disadvantages and applications. Each of them contributes to a different way of solving the energy production problem. Most solar thermal devices in production either consist of flat mirror arrays acting as heliostats, (a model which is efficient in large scale industrial energy production), or of parabolic mirrors. The second category includes, easier to construct, single curvature parabolic reflectors, which concentrate light in a line segment and more effective, (but also expensive), dishes (double curvature reflectors) which concentrate light in a point. There is also a recent complex invention with a Fresnel mirror system which tracks the sun and concentrates sunlight in a stable position, on the bottom of the moving device. This paper’s primary goal is to introduce another simple concept, which aims at cheap small-scale industrial energy production or even residential energy production systems on rooftops.

Device specification

The device consists of a moving heliostat and a stable thermoelectric generator which are connected together. The moving heliostat can be constructed out of 2 single curvature parabolic reflectors, vertically and statically positioned to each other. This set of two reflectors can move around the thermoelectric generator and concentrate sunlight on top of it, in order to provide thermal energy to power the electricity generator. An ideal (100 suns concentration) model device specification could be presented in picture 1 with the appropriate dimensions in cm. The most suitable material for constructing these reflectors seems to be aluminum, covered with highly reflective film (approximately 98% reflectiveness). The model device heliostat moves with 2 motors, one assigned to the wheel to control the orientation and the other assigned to the elevation mechanism to control the angle with the ground.

Advantages

This model device combines the manufacturing simplicity of single-curvature parabolic reflectors with a 2-dimensional concentration of light similar to dishes. In contrast with a parabolic dish reflector, this device can be built by amateurs also. The single curvature metallic surfaces used in the device can be easily reused in other ways when heat deformation ends their lifecycle as reflectors. But most importantly, the heliostat is able to rotate around a stable point, where the light is concentrated onto the immovable thermoelectric generator. A similar device consisting of a dish would need a heliostat moving at higher levels above the ground and confronting the wind with stronger materials, elevating the manufacturing costs. On the other hand, a top down beam Fresnel reflector concentrator demands much more complicated construction.
